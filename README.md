# Scaphirhynchus_albus_2.0
Data scripts for Nicole's pallid sturgeon DEB model for DEB2023

Currently working on implementing laboratory dataset (f1, f2, f3) where fish (approx 15 years old) were held at the same temperature (17.8 degrees Celsius), then placed into one of three feeding ration groups (f1 = 0.. fasted, f2 = medium ration ~0.5, f3 = high ration ~1). Need to implement ODE to inform the model as to an estimate of their preexisting reserves before starting the trial as these fish experienced good feeding conditions ~f=0.8 up until the beginning of the experiment.
